# üîó Threadlink

> **Let your documents remember your conversations.**

Threadlink is a lightweight CLI tool that creates persistent links between AI conversations and your local files. It's a protocol for memory‚Äîa way to trace any document back to the conversation that sparked it.

---

## ‚ú® The Problem

You have a great conversation with ChatGPT. It leads to a document, a design, some code. Two weeks later, you're looking at the file and wondering: 

> *"What was the context? What was I thinking?"*

**Threadlink solves this** by creating a simple, local-first connection between your AI conversations and the artifacts they inspire.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Install from GitHub
pip install git+https://github.com/thrialectics/threadlink.git

# Or clone and install locally
git clone https://github.com/thrialectics/threadlink.git
cd threadlink
pip install -e .
```

### Basic Usage

```bash
# 1. Create a thread reference
threadlink quick "Discussing API design patterns" https://chat.openai.com/c/abc123

# 2. Attach files to the thread
threadlink attach api_design_2025-06-02 ~/Documents/api_spec.md
threadlink attach api_design_2025-06-02 ~/Code/prototype.py

# 3. Later: "What conversation led to this file?"
threadlink reverse ~/Documents/api_spec.md
# ‚Üí Shows thread summary, chat URL, and linked files

# 4. Search your memory
threadlink search "API design"
```

## üß† Core Concepts

Threadlink uses a simple JSON index (`~/.threadlink/thread_index.json`) to maintain links between:

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Thread IDs** | Human-readable tags or UUIDs that identify conversations |
| **Chat URLs** | Direct links back to the source conversation |
| **Local Files** | Any documents, images, or code connected to that thread |
| **Metadata** | Summaries, timestamps, and context |

---

## üìñ Commands Reference

### Create a new thread

```bash
# With custom tag
threadlink new --tag project_x --summary "Project X brainstorming" --chat_url "https://..."

# Auto-generated tag
threadlink quick "Project X brainstorming" "https://..."
```

### Link files to threads

```bash
threadlink attach project_x ~/Documents/project_x_notes.md
```

### Find threads from files

```bash
threadlink reverse ~/Documents/project_x_notes.md
```

### Search your thread history

```bash
threadlink search "project"
```

### View thread details

```bash
threadlink show project_x
```

---

## üéØ Use Cases

### üìÅ Scenario 1: "Where did this file come from?"

You're browsing your projects folder and find some old designs. What were they for?

```bash
threadlink reverse ~/Projects/old_design.png
# ‚Üí Links back to the ChatGPT conversation that inspired them
```

### üîç Scenario 2: "I need to revisit that conversation"

You remember discussing something important but can't find the chat:

```bash
threadlink search "authentication"
# ‚Üí Finds all threads about authentication with their links
```

### üöÄ Scenario 3: "Keep this project's context together"

You're starting a new project with AI assistance:

```bash
threadlink quick "New startup idea discussion" "https://chat.openai.com/c/..."
threadlink attach new_startup_idea_2025-06-02 ~/Projects/startup/plan.md
threadlink attach new_startup_idea_2025-06-02 ~/Projects/startup/pitch.pdf
```

## üåü Philosophy

> Threadlink isn't trying to be another PKM tool or AI wrapper. It's a **protocol for memory**‚Äîa way to maintain context across the gap between conversation and creation. 

It respects your file system, your privacy, and your existing workflows.
